        bio: "Brick (@brick.909) is a San Francisco-based producer and DJ known for his unique sound that’s both nostalgic and forward-thinking. Originally from Northern California, he is a co-founder of Perfect Dark (@perfectdark909), a record label and artist collective dedicated to fostering communities united by a passion for dance music and ecological awareness. He is also a co-founder of the San Francisco-based label and studio, Capp Street Project. Drawing inspiration from 90s rave culture, Brick infuses his sets with a diverse spectrum of underground electronic music. His sets, whether live hardware performances or DJ mixes, are filled with unfiltered grooves and flawlessly executed blends that transport listeners across genre lines. Expect stripped-down, tooly techno paired with groovy, soulful rhythms that captivate audiences. Brick's commitment to creating immersive musical experiences and his ability to seamlessly weave diverse strands of underground electronic music into his performances make him a standout artist in the electronic music scene.",
